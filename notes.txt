Q: What are Arrays?
A: 
    - Collection of Items which are stored in a contiguous 
    memory location.
    - It is like a container.
    - Arrays are indexed from 0. Each element can be fetch
    using an index.
    - Array values should be of same data type. If an "int"
    array is created, then all the values in it should be of
    "int" type.
